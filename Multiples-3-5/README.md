## Problem: Multiples of 3 and 5

- If we list all of the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
- Find the __sum__ of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Instructions
- Code your procedural solution into the `lib/multiples.rb` file.
- Then when you have finished the procedural solution, code your object-oriented solution into the `lib/oo_multiples.rb` file.
- Run `learn` until you get all of the RSpec tests to pass.
